It is designed to speed up page loading times and decrease traffic to your users and customers by only loading the content in view. You can use Lazy in all scroll ways, from top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, left-to-right and right-to-left. It does not only support images in 'img' tags, even backgrounds, supplied with css like background-image or other methods, are supported. Lazy can set an default image and a placeholder while loading and support retina displays.",
